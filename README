This is the website i created for my wedding. It uses TiddlyWiki as the main framework, then i changed the layout, added plugins etc to make it a complete website. 
Some of the special features:
* Tiddlywiki based, with minimal php requirements (php was used to authenticate user name so i can edit and save the tiddlywiki online)
* Major customization of Tiddlywiki
* Integrated Tiddlywiki with a message board (the same one used for my website that used hand coded AJAX)
* Added flash player and built in music control
