XMBoard v1.0.3

please read the following:

-- php version --
xmboard is known to have problems with php versions older than 4.0.2

if you have an older version installed and you get an error about a 'wordwrap' statement,
replace line 117 of print.php with the following:
		print(nl2br($data), $OUTPUT_LINE_WIDTH, '<BR>', 1);
  
-- file permissions --
You have to set the file permissions as follows,
else your board won't work.

777 -rwxrwxrwx /data/          (read-, write-, and executable by everyone)
555 -rw-rw-rw- /data/board.xml (read- and writeable by everyone)


-- upgrading --
when upgrading from <= 1.0.1 you have to remove the file /data/board.xml.out by hand,
all other files (except the files in /data/) can be overwritten by the new ones.
